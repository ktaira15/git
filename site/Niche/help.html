    <h1>Questions</h1>
  </center>
  <p><b>If making a blog, how do I make it so that I won't have to go back and physically change specific css, html for new posts I upload? also how would i even upload those</b></p>
  <p><strike>Would like a more seamless transition effect on opacity for button--added it to the hover portion; works</strike></p>
  <p><strike>Unsure how to get button and title closer together--made negative top margin for text, seemed to work</strike></p>
  <p><strike>I want to do another button link, but I think in differnet colors and different opacity. I'm unsure how to do that with the style sheet; tried separating into divs, but then idk what to do with the "a"--solved using separate div classes for the buttons and for the hovers.</strike></p>
  <p><strike>is there a way to format my external style sheet so that it's not a bunch of messy divs all over the place for different pages? it's managable if i can't, but i'd prefer it more orgnanized</strike></p>
  <p>how would a general page, like settings, work? Just a deposit, a holding place, of posts and stuff? not really any content I make can go there atm</p>
  <p>How do you add captions to images?</p>
  <p><strike>How can I extend the nav bar to entire width of screen? Playing in width didn't work</strike></p>
  <p><strike>Can I only do inline style edits (ie size) to images? Tried using divs and wouldn't work--had to edit div and image max width, etc</strike></p>
  <p><strike>Now having issues getting my text to the right of my image instead of weirdly underneath--solved; don't use float, use inline blocks instead and make sure padding/margins are right for each other. Still working on how to do alignments. Apparently inline only works when you do image size to px instead of %. Floating works--both have to float left. it's like layering</strike></p>

    <h1>Next Steps</h1>
  </center>
  <p>How to best format pictures and do the text box on it</p>
  <p><b>Nav bar:</b>just float it left/right and see w3 for horizontal tips. Make it fixed with thin border</p>
  <p>I generally just need to get better with/find better font things</p>
  <p>Scrollbar</p>
  <p>mayve an interactive footer with info? generally just a footer</p>
  <p>Tip: why NM I1 page works is because text doesn't interfere with anything else--same color for scroll, looks cleaner</p>
  <p>NOTE: PHOTO1 WILL BE PHOTO ON LEFT, STORY ON LEFT THEN MAYBE WRAP; PHOTO2 WILL BE OVERLAYED TEXT</p>
  <p>work on design continuity for test page--titles, text, maybe try experimenting with transparent nav bar on home page, generally just try to format text</p>
  <p>test test test</p>

    The Northside/North Side is the definition of community. It’s the heart. It’s a degree of relativity. Small but mighty. A micro lifeology. Historical and astute. Our only cardinal direction is the lake. The Northside is our home. When our voices come together we don’t all sound the same, but that’s what tells more of our story. We are a mix of ages and races, built on strong traditions, diverse cultures, and inimitable characters. Nothing is black and white, though it’s never gray either. Vibrant colors paint our streets and define our neighborhoods. We have shared curiosities for how to better tomorrow. After all, we are tomorrow. It is us who seize the moment. Every moment. We stop, we think. We think, we observe. We hold our heads high. Our skin is thick. We’ve seen some shit. Some are born and raised, others are freshmen. We are hazed by change and enlightened by experience. Small businesses mark our corners. We welcome the new and embrace the old. Abandonment is opportunity, and opportunity is wonderful. Head home towards the lake.
