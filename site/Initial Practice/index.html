		<h1>PRELIMINARY CODING PRACTICE</h1>
    	<p>This is my attempt to make regular body text.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Something I read online said I should insert a few paragraph breaks to make editing my code easier.</p>
			<p>I'm also not entirely sure what the diference between a line break and a paragraph break is? Something went weird when I tried to do a line break in my blockquote, especially with the indent. Is there a way to indent with a line break? I should ask Tyler on Monday.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>
			<p>I'm also not sure what things i'm supposed to indent in this code more than others. Maybe it's something like semantic levels or embedding? I should also ask Tyler about this.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>
    <h2>TEXT PRACTICE</h2>
			<p>This is a test for different types of texts.</P>
				<p>For example, this is <b> bold</b>, this is <i> italic</i>, this is <u> underlined</u>, and this is <strike> strikethrough</strike>.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p></p>
				<p>This is an attempt at a <tt> different kind of font </tt> for when you're feeling fancy.</p>
				<p>The last thing that I am going to try is a block quote. This is an excerpt from a favorite poem of mine:</p>
				<blockquote>Go and catch a falling star,
					<p>Get with child a madrake root,
					<p>Tell me where all past years are,
					<p>Or who cleft the devil's foot,
					<p>Teach me to hear mermaid's singing,
					<p>Or to keep off envy's stinging,
						<p class="indented">And find
						<p class="indented">What wind
					<p>Serves to advance an honest mind.</blockquote>
				<p>Note: you change text style, color, etc. by putting in a style line in the head section.</p>
